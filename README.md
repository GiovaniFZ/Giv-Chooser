# Giv's Chooser

- Hey, this is my main project, the **Giv's Chooser!**
- With this tool, you can choose words or numbers in a range of your choice.
- For example, let's suppose you have to choose a number between X and Y. You're uncertain about which number you pick. Well, you can use this to pick automatically for you ðŸ˜‰
- Future plan: Implement tests and login with database

## Technologies
- React
- Vite

## API
This project is linked to an API (see the source code [here](https://github.com/GiovaniFZ/givs_shuffler_api))
If you wish to run this project locally, you'll need to run the API first, check the API README to know how to do it.

## Running
First, make sure you're running the API, then, open the FE folder and install the dependencies: 
```
npm install
```
Then, to run the project: 
```
npm run dev
```
Then, it will be available at localhost. Btw, any contributions will be welcome, thank you!
