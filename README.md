# Giv's Chooser

- Hey, this is my main project, the Giv's Chooser!
- Basically what is does is sort n numbers in a range, according with the count that user choose.
- In the future, I want to sort other things like words too!

## Technologies
- React
- Vite

## API
This project is linked to an API (see the source code [here](https://github.com/GiovaniFZ/givs_shuffler_api))
If you wish to run this project locally, you'll need to run the API first, check the API README to know how to do it.

## Running
First, make sure you're running the API, then, open the FE folder and install the dependencies: 
```
npm install
```
Then, to run the project: 
```
npm run dev
```
Then, it will be available at localhost. Btw, any contributions will be welcome, thank you!
